// Tools tests are temporarily disabled due to type compatibility issues
// TODO: Fix mock client interface compatibility with tools handlers
// The tools handlers expect a *utils.NomadClient but we're providing a *mocks.MockNomadClient
// This requires either:
// 1. Making MockNomadClient implement the same interface as NomadClient
// 2. Creating an interface that both can implement
// 3. Using dependency injection to make the handlers testable

// For now, we focus on testing the core client functionality in nomad_client_test.go
